    <p>
      Hey! I’m <strong>Dorian Smith</strong>, a professional full-stack developer with a love for retro games and chiptune music.
    </p>

    <p>
      I originally built <strong>8-Bit Composer</strong> to scratch my own itch — I was working on a retro-style game and needed an easy way to create authentic 8-bit music, right in the browser. Most tools I found were either overly complex or lacked that simple, grid-based workflow I wanted.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I built this: a web-based step sequencer for making 8-bit style tunes using classic synths and noise channels. You can compose by hand or describe what you want and let the AI help out — it uses Claude via AWS Bedrock for music generation.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to keep things lightweight, accessible, and fun for anyone making retro-inspired games or music. Whether you're a game dev, a musician, or just someone messing around — I hope you find it useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks for checking it out!
